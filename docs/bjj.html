  <h1>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h1>

  <p>
    Everyday, I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), which is a martial art
    that is similar to wrestling. The goal of BJJ is to submit your opponent
    by using either a joint lock like an armbar or choke. I have been training
    since 2018 and recently received my brown belt.
