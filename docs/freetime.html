  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy a long list of hobbies. 
    One of my favorites is playing chess. My favorite opening is the Queens Gambit
    and have an average Elo rating of 1200.

    I also enjoy riding motorcycles. Back in college, I used to own a 2007
    Kawasaki Ninja which was my main mode of transportation. Dirtbikes and bicycles
    are also fun to ride, but I have on the lookout for my next street bike.
  
    I'm an active member of Toastmasters International, which is a club designed
    to help people improve their public speaking and leadership skills.

    I love cats, and while I don't own one, I'm always on the lookout to befriend a stray.
